# Installation

To install `diem`, first create a new conda environment then use pip to install the package

```sh
conda create -n diem python=3.11
conda activate diem
python -m pip install https://github.com/Studenecivb/diemPy/archive/main.zip
```

`diem` can be installed as a package and used in any python script. This means that the big tasks like polarization can be offloaded to a computing cluster. However, for many datasets, `diem` can run on a modern laptop. We recommend using `diem` and exploring the data within a jupyter notebook, and jupyter lab comes pre-installed.
