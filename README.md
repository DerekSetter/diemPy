## diemPy

A Python package for genome polarization and subsequent analyses using the `diem` (Diagnostic Index for the Expectation Maximization) method [1]

## Overview

`diemPy` is a computational tool designed to polarize genomic data for hybrid zone analysis. The package implements an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to determine the optimal polarization of genetic markers, enabling researchers to identify and analyze patterns of introgression and hybridization in genomic datasets.



## Key Features
- VCF processing and format conversion
- Automated genome polarization using EM algorithm
- Kernel smoothing and tract length analysis
- Parallel processing support
- Flexible I/O for various genomic formats


## Documentation

The core concepts, installation, and API documentation can be found here:
